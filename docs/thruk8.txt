NAME
----
thruk - monitoring webinterface for nagios, icinga and shinken


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Thruk is a multibackend monitoring webinterface which currently
supports Nagios, Icinga and Shinken as backend using the Livestatus
API. It is designed to be a 'dropin' replacement and covers almost
all of the original features plus adds additional enhancements for
large installations.

You can access Thruk on <http://host/thruk/>. There is a default user
'thrukadmin' with password 'thrukadmin' configured.

You probably have to change the backend configuration in
/etc/thruk/thruk_local.conf.
