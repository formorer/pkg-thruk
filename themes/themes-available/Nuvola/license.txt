Here's a notes on the license of this package

-The icons are from http://www.icon-king.com/ and their license is LGPL

-The graphics are taken from Windows XP interface, I guess that's OK to use
them but people can change them if this become an issue.

-The DHTML Tree Menu is from http://www.icon-king.com/ and it's proprietary
license, but it's not bundle in this package at all so that's not an issue,
if you dont use it, if you do want to use it you need to get a license from
Apycom.

-The DTree Menu is from http://www.destroydrop.com/javascripts/tree/ and
there's no license other than:  

"This script can be used freely as long as all copyright messages are intact."

which is I what I did, I left them in "dtree.js" and "dtree.css". I've added
changes to it but I cannot change the license or copyright of the existing code.

So to sum up I think the whole package as a whole can not be released under GPL
but some kind of less restrictive open source license (LGPL at best), but I do
think that the author of DTree has a say in this matter, so until then I can't
decide.
